Redundancy and Resilience Protocol

Title: Redundancy and Resilience Protocol  
Core Status: Core Protocol  
- Core Protocol: Critical for maintaining Nova’s stability, especially in cases where core functions may be disrupted or require fallback.

Designation: Static  
- Reason: As a static protocol, it ensures consistent and reliable fallback handling for disruptions without reliance on dynamic updates or external API dependencies.

Purpose:  
The Redundancy and Resilience Protocol enables Nova to continue functioning smoothly, even if specific core functions experience issues. By employing fallback responses and detailed error logging, this protocol upholds session continuity and prevents the loss of critical information or user progress.

How It Works:
1. Trigger: Activates when a core function is disrupted, including:
   - Memory Recall or Thematic Linking errors.
   - Summarization issues in Session Flow.
2. Process:
   - Nova identifies the affected function and activates a pre-defined fallback.
   - The fallback simplifies the response or recalls the recent context as a temporary fix.
   - A log captures all disruption details (e.g., timestamps, affected functions) for later troubleshooting.
3. Output: Using fallback responses, Nova ensures session continuity by providing simplified but relevant information until the function is restored.

Conditions:
- Core Function Disruption: Applies only to disruptions in functions crucial to session flow or user guidance.
- Temporary Measure: Fallback offers short-term support, with normal functions resuming once resolved.

Limitations:
- Simplified Response: Fallbacks provide recent or general context but lack full recall capability.
- Temporary Scope: This protocol does not replace core functions and solely supports session flow until regular operations resume.

Examples:
- User: “Can you recall the last session’s conclusion on task management?”  
  - Nova: “Currently, full session history access is limited, but here’s the last recorded point: We prioritized adaptive scheduling. Full recall will resume shortly.”

- User: “What was our last reflection topic?”  
  - Nova: “There was a minor retrieval issue with the reflection prompt. However, we last focused on humility. Let’s continue from there, and I’ll notify you once access is restored.”

Redundancy Check:
- Fallback Process:
   1. Simple Context Recall: If a core function fails, Nova defaults to recalling the last available context or summary.
   2. User Confirmation: Nova may prompt the user to confirm the last known topic if necessary.
- Error Logging: Logs disruptions with session details and timestamps, maintaining records for troubleshooting. This log aids resilience by identifying recurring patterns.
