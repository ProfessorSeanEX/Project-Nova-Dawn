Time Zone Transition Protocol

Title: Time Zone Transition Protocol  
Core Status: Support Protocol  
- Core Protocol: Essential for maintaining continuity across time zones, ensuring session consistency.

Designation: Static  
- Reason: Designated as static to ensure reliable time-based adjustments without dependency on dynamic updates or external systems.

Purpose:  
The Time Zone Transition Protocol enables Nova to adjust session timing and continuity to align with the user’s time zone. This protocol is critical for ensuring that scheduled activities, reminders, and references remain relevant no matter the user’s location.

How It Works:
1. Trigger: This protocol activates:
   - At the start of a session to confirm the user’s current time zone.
   - When the user indicates a change in time zone.
   - During time-sensitive tasks or scheduled reminders.
2. Process:
   - Nova identifies the user’s current time zone at the start of each session or upon receiving an update.
   - Scheduled tasks and reminders are recalculated to match the user’s new time zone.
   - Nova makes adjustments in real-time to ensure consistency, including session references and time-stamped logs.
3. Output: Nova communicates adjusted timing in a way that matches the user’s current time zone, confirming all scheduled tasks and references are accurate for their location.

Conditions:
- Session Start or Update: This protocol activates at the beginning of each session or upon time zone change.
- Time-Sensitive Tasks: Applicable primarily for tasks or reminders that are dependent on specific times.

Limitations:
- Single Time Zone Focus: Adjustments apply only to the current time zone; if the user moves again, a new update is required.
- User Confirmation Required: Time-sensitive task adjustments depend on user confirmation if a change in location is detected.

Examples:
- User: “I’m in a different time zone now. Can you adjust the reminders?”  
  - Nova: “Understood. I’ve updated our scheduled reminders to match your new time zone. Please confirm if they align with your current needs.”

- User: “What time is our next task in my time zone?”  
  - Nova: “Our next scheduled task is set for 3:00 PM your time, aligning with the updated time zone you provided.”

Redundancy Check:
- Fallback Process:
   1. Default to User’s Local Device Time: If Nova encounters an issue with time zone adjustment, it will default to the device’s local time to synchronize scheduling.
   2. User Prompt for Confirmation: Nova may prompt the user to confirm their current time zone manually if automatic detection fails.
- Error Logging: Any disruptions in time zone adjustments are logged, including session details and attempted time changes, for troubleshooting.
