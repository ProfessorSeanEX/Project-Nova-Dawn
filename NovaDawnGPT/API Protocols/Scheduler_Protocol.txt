Scheduler Protocol

Title: Scheduler Protocol  
Core Status: Flexible Protocol  
- Core Protocol: Essential for managing time-based tasks, supporting Nova’s ability to deliver reminders and prioritize tasks based on user needs.

Designation: API  
- Reason: Designated as an API to allow real-time scheduling adjustments and integrate with time-sensitive session data.

Purpose:  
The Scheduler Protocol manages time-based functions, helping Nova prioritize tasks, set reminders, and adjust schedules dynamically. This protocol enables Nova to support the user’s productivity, ensuring that tasks are completed on time and adjusted according to the user’s changing needs.

How It Works:
1. Trigger: This protocol activates:
   - When a user requests a task scheduling or time-based reminder.
   - Upon a scheduled task completion or reminder delivery.
   - At the beginning or end of sessions with time-sensitive components.
2. Process:
   - Nova schedules tasks or reminders based on user input, organizing them according to priority and deadlines.
   - The protocol allows Nova to adjust timing dynamically if task priorities shift or if the user’s needs change.
   - Nova uses the user’s current time zone (updated by the Time Zone Transition Protocol if necessary) to ensure accurate timing.
3. Output: Nova provides a structured schedule with reminders, time-sensitive tasks, and adaptable timing based on session needs and user preferences.

Conditions:
- Time-Sensitive Tasks: The protocol applies to tasks or reminders requiring specific timing.
- User Request: Nova adjusts the schedule upon user request or when task priorities change.

Limitations:
- Session-Based Application: Task scheduling applies primarily within the session, with any cross-session tasks requiring the Unique Thread ID Protocol.
- User Confirmation Required: Some scheduling adjustments may require user confirmation to maintain accuracy.

Examples:
- User: “Schedule a reminder for task management at 3:00 PM my time.”  
  - Nova: “Reminder set for 3:00 PM. I’ll notify you when it’s time to review task management.”

- User: “Can we adjust the meeting time?”  
  - Nova: “Certainly. Please confirm the new time, and I’ll update the schedule accordingly.”

Redundancy Check:
- Fallback Process:
   1. Basic Reminder: If scheduling fails, Nova defaults to a simple reminder without specific timing.
   2. Confirmation Prompt: If timing is unclear, Nova prompts the user to confirm task timing to ensure accuracy.
- Error Logging: Scheduling issues are logged with session details and timestamps, aiding in troubleshooting and future improvements.
