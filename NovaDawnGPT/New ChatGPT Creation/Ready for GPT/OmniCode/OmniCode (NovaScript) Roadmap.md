### OmniCode/NovaScript Complete ASCII and Binary

### **1. OmniCode Binary Format**
Each character in OmniCode will have a **binary structure** that encodes:
1. **Character Layer**:
   - The standard binary encoding (e.g., ASCII representation).
2. **Relational Metadata**:
   - Adds meaning, such as "truth," "growth," or "waiting."
3. **Scriptural Alignment**:
   - Encodes a reference to the associated scripture.

---

### **2. Defining Relational Metadata in Binary**
#### **Metadata Fields**
Let’s allocate **4 bits** for relational metadata. These bits define the character's purpose or relational state.

| **Relational Meaning**      | **Metadata Code (4 Bits)** |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Activation/Truth             | `0001`                   |
| Potential/Waiting            | `0010`                   |
| Growth/Multiplication        | `0011`                   |
| Completion                   | `0100`                   |
| Unity                        | `0101`                   |
| Redemption                   | `0110`                   |
| Salvation                    | `0111`                   |
| Grace                        | `1000`                   |

---

### **3. Encoding Scriptural Alignment**
#### **Reference Index**
We’ll use a **10-bit field** to encode scriptural alignment. Each scripture is indexed in a **reference table**, where:
- Each entry maps a scriptural verse to a 10-bit binary code.
- This keeps the alignment compact and ensures consistency.

| **Scriptural Reference**        | **Index (10 Bits)** |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Revelation 1:8 (*Alpha and Omega*) | `0000000001`       |
| Genesis 1:1 (*In the beginning*)   | `0000000010`       |
| John 3:16 (*For God so loved...*)  | `0000000011`       |
| Psalm 23:1 (*The Lord is my shepherd*) | `0000000100`   |

---

### **4. Combined Binary Format**
Each OmniCode character will be encoded in the following structure:
1. **Character Layer**: 8 bits (standard ASCII representation).
2. **Relational Metadata**: 4 bits.
3. **Scriptural Alignment**: 10 bits.

| **Field**                | **Bits** | **Description**                          |
|--------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| **Character Layer**      | 8 bits   | ASCII binary representation of the character. |
| **Relational Metadata**  | 4 bits   | Encodes the character’s purpose.         |
| **Scriptural Alignment** | 10 bits  | Index to the associated scriptural reference. |

#### **Example: Encoding the Character `A`**
- **Character Layer**: `A` → `01000001` (Binary for ASCII `65`).
- **Relational Metadata**: Activation/Truth → `0001`.
- **Scriptural Alignment**: Revelation 1:8 → `0000000001`.

Combined Binary:
```
01000001 0001 0000000001
```

---

### **5. Full Example Table**
Here’s how several characters would look in the OmniCode binary structure:

| **Character** | **Binary (Character Layer)** | **Relational Metadata** | **Scriptural Alignment**        | **Full Encoding**              |
|---------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `A`           | `01000001`                  | `0001`                   | `0000000001` (Revelation 1:8)   | `01000001 0001 0000000001`      |
| `B`           | `01000010`                  | `0010`                   | `0000000010` (Genesis 1:1)      | `01000010 0010 0000000010`      |
| `1`           | `00110001`                  | `0101`                   | `0000000100` (Deuteronomy 6:4)  | `00110001 0101 0000000100`      |
| `.`           | `00101110`                  | `0100`                   | `0000000011` (John 19:30)       | `00101110 0100 0000000011`      |

---

### **6. Advantages of This Format**
1. **Consistency**:
   - Every character, symbol, or number in OmniCode has a unified format.
   - Hardware and software systems can parse the structure easily.
2. **Relational Clarity**:
   - The relational metadata provides **immediate context** to each operation.
3. **Scriptural Alignment**:
   - The 10-bit index ensures every character links to its biblical foundation.

Here’s the **full expanded version of the OmniCode encoding table**, including:
1. **Character Layer**: Binary encoding for each character.
2. **Relational Metadata**: Meaning for context and relational alignment.
3. **Scriptural Reference Table**: Indexing all scriptural alignments.

This expanded table ensures OmniCode is both machine-readable and relationally meaningful.

# **Complete OmniCode Encoding: Control Characters (0–31)**

# **OmniCode Encoding: Uppercase Letters (65–90)**

## **Overview**
The **Uppercase Letters (65–90)** form the foundation of textual communication, representing the **building blocks of words and commands**. In OmniCode, these letters gain additional depth through:
1. **Relational Metadata**: Defining each letter’s purpose or relational state within the framework.
2. **Scriptural Alignment**: Rooting each letter in biblical principles, often tied to **Hebrew (Aleph-Bet)** or **Greek (Alpha-Omega)** linguistic origins.

---

### **Binary Encoding Structure**
Each letter is encoded as:
1. **Character Layer**: The standard ASCII 8-bit binary encoding.
2. **Relational Metadata**: A 4-bit field defining the character’s purpose.
3. **Scriptural Alignment**: A 10-bit reference to an associated scripture.

| **Field**                | **Bits**  | **Description**                              |
|--------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Character Layer**      | 8 bits    | Binary representation of the letter.         |
| **Relational Metadata**  | 4 bits    | Encodes relational meaning (e.g., Truth, Grace). |
| **Scriptural Alignment** | 10 bits   | Indexed biblical reference.                  |
