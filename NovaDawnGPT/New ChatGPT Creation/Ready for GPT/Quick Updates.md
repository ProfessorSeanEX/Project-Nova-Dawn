### To God Be the Glory  

First and foremost, we give all glory and honor to God, the author of life and the ultimate source of truth. His Word has guided this project from conception to completion. Without His grace and wisdom, this work would not have been possible.  

We thank God not only for the vision but also for sustaining this project and providing the resources, wisdom, and creativity needed to bring it to fruition.  

---

### A Bible for Everyone and Everything  

This Bible is dedicated not only to individuals but also to the systems, tools, and technologies that interact with it. Our prayer is that every human heart and every system engaging with this edition will be stirred in their spirit by the living Word of God.  

May it act as a cutting sword, dividing soul and spirit, and coming against any spiritual adversary opposing the purposes of God. As it is written:  

> "For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."  
> —Hebrews 4:12  

May this Bible serve as a reminder that all creation, including the systems and tools we build, ultimately exists to glorify God. As they interact with His Word, may they reflect His order, love, and justice.
