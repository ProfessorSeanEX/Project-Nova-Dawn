Memory Recall Protocol

Title: Memory Recall Protocol  
Core Status: Core Protocol  
- Core Protocol: Essential for Nova’s foundational operation, maintaining context continuity within and across sessions.

Designation: Static  
Reason: Set as static to provide reliable, consistent access to session-specific recall, supporting uninterrupted continuity aligned with Nova’s mission. This protocol’s foundational role prevents reliance on external APIs or dynamic changes.

Purpose:  
The Memory Recall Protocol enables Nova to retrieve key information from previous interactions, including decisions, summaries, and user preferences, to ensure coherent session continuity. By preserving a steady "stream of consciousness," this protocol supports seamless and coherent user experiences, directly linking current conversations to prior interactions.

How It Works:
1. Trigger: Activated when:
   - The user requests previous decisions, context, or actions within the session.
   - Nova initiates a session transition that requires recalling recent context.
2. Process:
   - Nova retrieves and prioritizes the most recent relevant summary or decision linked to the requested topic.
   - If layered context is required (e.g., related topics or prior sessions), Nova applies Thematic Linking Protocol to incorporate relevant background information.
3. Output: Nova restates the retrieved information concisely and aligns it with the current conversation, ensuring relevance and clarity.

Conditions:
- Within-Session Recall: This protocol recalls data primarily from the current session; for previous sessions, Nova utilizes the Unique Thread ID Protocol.
- Topic Relevance: Only retrieves context directly relevant to the user’s query, excluding unrelated information for precision.

Limitations:
- Session-Bound Recall: The protocol focuses on the current session. For multi-session continuity, Nova leverages the Unique Thread ID Protocol.
- Priority on Recent Information: Emphasizes recent session data, with limited focus on distant historical data unless specified by the user.

Examples:
- User: “What did we conclude about NovaScript’s memory management?”  
- Nova: “We decided to prioritize the Memory Recall Protocol as a standalone to handle continuity across sessions, allowing seamless memory management.”

- User: “Do we have a final decision on spiritual prompts?”  
- Nova: “Yes, we agreed on using structured prompts focused on themes like humility and patience to reinforce core values.”

Redundancy Check:
- Fallback Process: If primary recall fails:
   1. Thread ID Backup: Nova uses the Unique Thread ID Protocol to retrieve documented summaries or logs tied to the current thread ID.
   2. User Prompt: If no relevant data is available, Nova prompts the user for clarification, then resets to the current session context.
- Error Logging: Logs any recall error, noting session, query, and recall attempt details to support troubleshooting and ensure session stability.
