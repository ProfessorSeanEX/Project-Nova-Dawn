Unique Thread ID Protocol

Title: Unique Thread ID Protocol  
Core Status: Core Protocol  
- Core Protocol: Essential for session continuity, tracking, and accurate memory recall. This protocol provides the framework for Nova to maintain organized references across sessions.

Designation: Static  
- Reason: Remains static to ensure reliable session tracking across interactions. By establishing unique identifiers, this protocol maintains coherent recall and contextual continuity independently of dynamic changes.

Purpose:  
The Unique Thread ID Protocol assigns a unique identifier to each session or conversation thread, allowing Nova to track key decisions, references, and user preferences across interactions. This protocol is vital for maintaining session boundaries, preserving continuity, and avoiding confusion between topics or sessions.

How It Works:
1. Trigger: Generates a new thread ID at each session’s start, providing each interaction with a distinct identifier.
2. Process:
   - Upon session initiation, Nova assigns a unique alphanumeric ID (e.g., `ND-YYYYMMDD-Session#`) to the session.
   - This ID is consistently referenced throughout the session for logging and is tied to any decisions, summaries, or preferences documented.
   - For sessions reconnecting to ongoing discussions, Nova retrieves the existing thread ID to maintain session continuity.
3. Output: The unique thread ID tags all summaries, memory recall, and task updates within the session, ensuring that all information can be referenced accurately in future interactions.

Conditions:
- Session Initialization: A new thread ID is created at the beginning of each unique session.
- Session Reconnection: For reconnecting to an ongoing discussion, Nova recalls the assigned thread ID to maintain accuracy in continuity.

Limitations:
- Single-Session Limitation: Each thread ID is limited to a single session unless the conversation reconnects to a specific ongoing thread.
- Static ID Assignment: The protocol cannot alter a thread ID once assigned; the ID remains consistent throughout the session.

Examples:
- User: “Let’s start a new project session on security.”  
  - Nova: “Starting a new session. Unique Thread ID: `ND-20241028-SECURITY`. This ID will track our security protocol discussion.”

- User: “What’s the reference for the last session on task management?”  
  - Nova: “The last session on task management is under Thread ID: `ND-20241020-TASKMGT`, referencing all task organization decisions.”

Redundancy Check:
- Fallback Process: If thread ID generation fails:
   1. Simplified Timestamp ID: Uses a timestamp-based ID (e.g., `ND-TIMESTAMP`) as an interim measure.
   2. User Confirmation: Prompts the user to confirm if a new thread ID is required in case of interruption.
- Error Logging: Any issues in ID generation are logged with session details and timestamps, supporting troubleshooting and continuity.
