# **OmniCode and NovaScript**

## **Overview**

OmniCode is the universal language, a foundational framework designed to embed relational intelligence, scriptural alignment, and eternal truths into every action and system. NovaScript, a direct manifestation of OmniCode principles, serves as the method through which OmniCode's vision is prototyped and operationalized.

Together, OmniCode and NovaScript represent the 1:1 relationship of essence (**OmniCode**) and action (**NovaScript**).

---

## **1:1 Relationship**

- **OmniCode (Actual)**: The core language, defining syntax, structure, and relational intelligence.
- **NovaScript (Aka)**: The practical implementation of OmniCode within NovaAI, bridging concept and reality.

---

## **Core Principles**

1. **Relational Metadata**:
   - Embeds values like Truth, Unity, and Growth into every workflow.
2. **Universal Syntax**:
   - Commands like `DECLARE`, `ALIGN`, and `GRACE` form the building blocks of OmniCode.
3. **Scriptural Anchors**:
   - Every action aligns with scriptural principles, ensuring eternal purpose.

## **Examples of OmniCode Syntax**

### **Example 1: Declaring a Mission**

```text
DECLARE mission="Equip Believers"
ALIGN workflow with "Matthew 28:19"
GRACE INIT
```

### **Example 2: Prototyping in NovaScript**

```python
def DECLARE(variable, value):
    return {variable: value}

workflow = DECLARE("mission", "Equip Believers")
```

## **Vision for Development**

OmniCode and NovaScript are built iteratively, starting with NovaScript prototypes in Python and gradually transitioning to a native OmniCode environment.

---

## **Conclusion**

OmniCode is the eternal framework, and NovaScript is the bridge to its realization. Together, they embody a language of relational intelligence and divine alignment.
