# OmniCode Syntax Guide

## Overview

OmniCode is a divinely inspired, relational coding language rooted in Scripture. It serves as a **web of meta-relationships**, connecting high-level workflows, low-level logic, and the foundational truths of Godâ€™s Word. OmniCode challenges traditional programming by embedding scriptural principles at every level, transforming logic, and redefining computation.

---

### **Key Note**

OmniCode is not a traditional programming language. Its foundation is **scriptural truth**, requiring programmers to align with Scripture to understand and utilize its syntax and workflows. The Bible (KJV or WEB) is the definitive reference for OmniCode, providing the eternal principles upon which every command, workflow, and system is based.

This scriptural alignment forms the bridge between high-level commands (e.g., `ALIGN`, `DECLARE`) and the binary foundations of computation (e.g., **truth (1)** and **absence (0)**), creating a seamless relational web across all levels.

## Core Syntax Rules

### 1. Command Structure

- **Basic Format**:

  ```text
  COMMAND target WITH details
  ```

  - **COMMAND**: The action to execute (e.g., `DECLARE`, `ALIGN`).
  - **target**: The subject of the action (e.g., `mission`, `workflow`).
  - **details**: Additional parameters or metadata (e.g., scriptural anchors, relational attributes).

- **Example**:

  ```text
  DECLARE mission="Equip Believers"
  ALIGN workflow WITH "Matthew 28:19"
  GRACE INIT {"compassion": True, "unity": True}
  ```

---

### 2. Relational Metadata

- Commands include **metadata attributes** such as:
  - **Truth**: Ensures integrity.
  - **Unity**: Promotes collaboration.
  - **Compassion**: Embeds relational empathy.

- **Example**:

  ```text
  GRACE INIT {"truth": True, "unity": True, "compassion": True}
  ```

---

### 3. Scriptural Anchors

- OmniCode integrates **scriptural references** to guide workflows.
- Syntax:

  ```text
  ALIGN target WITH "Scripture Reference"
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```text
  ALIGN mission WITH "Proverbs 3:5-6"
  ```

---

### 4. Comments

- Use `#` for inline comments to provide context or explanation.
- **Example**:

  ```text
  # Aligning workflow with the Great Commission
  ALIGN workflow WITH "Matthew 28:19"
  ```

---

## Core Commands

### **1. DECLARE**

- Defines a variable or mission.
- **Syntax**:

  ```text
  DECLARE target="value"
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```text
  DECLARE mission="Equip Believers"
  ```

---

### **2. ALIGN**

- Aligns workflows, resources, or systems with a relational or scriptural anchor.
- **Syntax**:

  ```text
  ALIGN target WITH "details"
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```text
  ALIGN workflow WITH "Matthew 28:19"
  ALIGN memory WITH "Mission Priority"
  ```

---

### **3. GRACE**

- Initializes workflows with relational metadata.
- **Syntax**:

  ```text
  GRACE INIT {"attribute": value}
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```text
  GRACE INIT {"truth": True, "unity": True, "compassion": True}
  ```

---

### **4. SEARCH**

- Queries relational or scriptural data from FaithNet or local sources.
- **Syntax**:

  ```text
  SEARCH target FOR "query"
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```text
  SEARCH scripture FOR "Unity in Ephesians"
  ```

---

### **5. BROADCAST**

- Shares data or updates across systems.
- **Syntax**:

  ```text
  BROADCAST target="message"
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```text
  BROADCAST system_status="Grace Node Initialized"
  ```

---

### **6. TRANSLATE**

- Converts workflows or commands into other formats or systems.
- **Syntax**:

  ```text
  TRANSLATE source TO "format"
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```text
  TRANSLATE workflow TO "JSON"
  ```

---

## Advanced Concepts

### **1. Nested Workflows**

- Combine multiple commands into a single workflow.
- **Syntax**:

  ```text
  COMMAND target WITH {subcommands}
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```text
  GRACE INIT {
      "compassion": True,
      "subworkflow": {
          "ALIGN": "workflow WITH Matthew 28:19"
      }
  }
  ```

---

### **2. Relational Validation**

- Validate workflows against relational attributes or scriptural alignment.
- **Syntax**:

  ```text
  VALIDATE workflow FOR "attribute"
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```text
  VALIDATE workflow FOR "truth"
  ```

---

### **3. Error Handling**

- OmniCode provides clear feedback for invalid commands.
- **Syntax**:

  ```text
  ERROR "description"
  ```

- **Example**:

  ```text
  ERROR "ALIGN command missing scriptural anchor"
  ```

---

## Example Workflow

### Aligning a Mission

```text
# Define the mission
DECLARE mission="Equip Believers"

# Align the workflow with the Great Commission
ALIGN workflow WITH "Matthew 28:19"

# Initialize Grace Node with relational attributes
GRACE INIT {"truth": True, "unity": True, "compassion": True}
```

---

### **Vision for OmniCode Syntax**

1. **Scriptural Foundation**: Commands and logic are rooted in Scripture.
2. **Relational Intelligence**: Syntax reflects relational attributes and contextual awareness.
3. **Meta-Relationships**: The syntax connects high-level workflows to foundational logic through a relational web.
